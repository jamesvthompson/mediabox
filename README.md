# Mediabox (Testing Branch ‚Äì Modular Compose)
> **This branch contains the new modular compose system** with per-app fragments, a dynamic `docker-compose.generated.yml`, and enhanced `mediabox.sh` flags.

**Repo URL:** [https://github.com/jamesvthompson/mediabox/tree/testing](https://github.com/jamesvthompson/mediabox/tree/testing)

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git checkout testing
./mediabox.sh --interactive
```

The interactive menu lets you toggle apps before launching.  
Your choices are saved in `prep/config.yml` under `apps:`.

---

## üß© Modular Compose

Instead of one huge `docker-compose.yml`, apps now live in:
```
compose/base.yml        # always included
compose/<app>.yml       # one per app/service
```

`./mediabox.sh` uses `scripts/generate-compose.sh` to combine only the enabled apps into:
```
docker-compose.generated.yml
```

---

## ‚úÖ Category Requirements

Your selection **must** include:

1. **One download client**  
   - `delugevpn` \| `qbittorrentvpn` \| `sabnzbd`
2. **One manager**  
   - `radarr` \| `sonarr` \| `lidarr` \| `headphones`
3. **One player**  
   - `plex` \| `emby` \| `jellyfin`

If any category is missing, the script will exit with a friendly error and tips.

## ‚öôÔ∏è New Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--list-apps` | Show all available apps and which are enabled in `prep/config.yml`. |
| `--enable <apps>` | Permanently enable apps in `prep/config.yml`. |
| `--disable <apps>` | Permanently disable apps in `prep/config.yml`. |
| `--interactive` | Menu to toggle apps before launch. Saves to `prep/config.yml`. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the merged compose file to stdout, do not write or launch. |
| `--no-launch` | Generate compose file but do not start containers. |
| `--check-env` | Verify required environment variables (VPN creds, etc.). |
| `--apps <list>` | Override enabled apps for this run only. Comma/space separated. |

---

## üí° Examples

Run interactively:
```bash
./mediabox.sh --interactive
```

Enable Overseerr and disable Plex permanently, but don‚Äôt launch:
```bash
./mediabox.sh --enable overseerr --disable plex --no-launch
```

Preview a stack with Plex, Sonarr, and DelugeVPN:
```bash
./mediabox.sh --apps "plex sonarr delugevpn" --dry-run
```

Launch using currently enabled apps:
```bash
./mediabox.sh
```

---

## üì¶ Adding a New App

1. Create `compose/<app>.yml` with the service definition.  
2. Add `app: true/false` under `apps:` in `prep/config.yml`.  
3. Select via `--apps`, `--enable`, or `--interactive`.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

- **Missing VPN credentials?**  
  Use `.env` in repo root or export vars:
  ```bash
  export VPN_USER=myuser
  export VPN_PASS=mypass
  ```

- **Missing category requirement?**  
  Add at least 1 from each: **download client**, **manager**, **player**.

* [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
* [VPN account from Private internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) (Please see [binhex's Github Repo](https://github.com/binhex/arch-delugevpn) if you want to use a different VPN)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### **PLEASE NOTE**

For simplicity's sake (eg. automatic dependency management), the method used to install these packages is Ubuntu's default package manager, [APT](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt).  There are several other methods that work just as well, if not better (especially if you don't have superuser access on your system), so use whichever method you prefer.  Continue when you've successfully installed all packages listed.

### Installation

(You'll need superuser access to run these commands successfully)

## Installation (Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS)

### 1) Update and upgrade packages
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

### 2) Install prerequisites
```bash
sudo apt install -y curl git bridge-utils whiptail
```

### 3) Remove old Docker (OK if nothing to remove)
```bash
sudo apt remove -y docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo snap remove docker
```

### 4) Install Docker CE (official method)
```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) stable" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify:
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### 5) Add your user to the docker group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### 6) DelugeVPN kernel module
```bash
sudo /sbin/modprobe iptable_mangle
echo iptable_mangle | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

### 7) Reboot (recommended if Docker group just added)
```bash
sudo reboot
```
## Using mediabox

Once the prerequisites are all taken care of you can move forward with using mediabox.

### 8) Clone Mediabox
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesvthompson/mediabox.git
cd mediabox
```

### 9) Configure & Deploy
```bash
# Run the Mediabox setup script (collects .env and prepares compose)
./mediabox.sh
```

### Notes
- **Plex tag:** set `PMSTAG` in `.env` (e.g., `public` or `plexpass`). Example image:
  `image: plexinc/pms-docker:${PMSTAG:-public}`
- If you change image tags, test them directly first:
  
## Using mediabox

### Please be prepared to supply the following details after you run Step 3 above

As the script runs you will be prompted for:

1. Your Private Internet Access credentials
    * **username**
    * **password**

2. The version of Plex you want to run
    * **latest**
    * **public**
    * **plexpass**

    Note: If you choose plexpass as your version you may optionally specify CLAIM_TOKEN - you can get your claim token by logging in at [plex.tv/claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim)

3. Credentials for the NBZGet interface and the Deluge daemon which needed for the CouchPotato container.
    * **username**
    * **password**

Upon completion, the script will launch your mediabox containers.  

Portainer has been switched to the **CE** branch  

* **A Password** will now be required - the password can be set at initial login to Portiner.  
* **Initial Username** The initial username for Portainer is **admin**  

### **Mediabox has been tested to work on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS / 20.04 LTS - Server and Desktop**
